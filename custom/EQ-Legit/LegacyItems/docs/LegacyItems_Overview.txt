EQ‑Legit — EverQuest Legacy Item Restoration Project
Legacy Items Module — Overview

The Legacy Items Module restores a curated set of classic-era EverQuest items
that were removed, nerfed, or made unobtainable in modern EQEmu databases.
This module focuses on meaningful, iconic drops that enhance solo-friendly,
time-realistic gameplay without overwhelming the loot ecosystem.

All items in this module:
- Are classic-era appropriate
- Drop from era-appropriate NPCs
- Follow standardized EQ‑Legit drop rate rules
- Are fully modular and isolated from core EQEmu data
- Use normalized SQL structure (01–10)

This module includes:
- 20 restored classic items
- Lootdrops for each item
- Loottables for each item
- NPC wiring for all drops
- Verification queries

No new NPCs, items, or spawns are created. This module only restores loot logic.

Zones involved:
- Lower Guk
- Solusek A / Solusek B
- Velious outdoor named

This module is part of the larger EQ‑Legit project, which includes:
- Legacy Items Module
- CT Mosquito Restoration Module
- Quest Restoration Module
