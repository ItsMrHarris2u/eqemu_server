# EQ‑Legit — EverQuest Legacy Item Restoration Project
## Project Overview

EQ‑Legit is a modular restoration framework designed to reintroduce classic-era
EverQuest items, quests, and NPC ecosystems that were removed or altered in
modern EQEmu databases. The project focuses on historical authenticity,
solo-friendly accessibility, and long-term maintainability.

### Core Principles
- **Historical Accuracy**  
  Every restored item, NPC, and quest is based on classic-era behavior.

- **Modularity**  
  Each restoration type is isolated into its own module:
  - Loot_Items — loot-based legacy items  
  - Quest_Items — quest-based legacy items  
  - Orphan_Items — items with missing NPC or mechanic sources  

- **Scalability**  
  All modules follow the universal 01–10 SQL structure for predictable loading.

- **Documentation First**  
  Every module includes a complete `/docs` folder for OneNote and GitHub clarity.

### Project Goals
- Restore all legacy items from the EQ-Legit master list.
- Rebuild missing NPC ecosystems where required.
- Re-enable classic quests tied to legacy items.
- Maintain a clean, professional, and future-proof repository.

EQ‑Legit is designed as a long-term preservation project, not a content overhaul.
