Quest Flow

This file explains how each restored quest functions within the EQ-Legit
framework. It documents the intended progression, required items, NPC dialogue,
turn-ins, and reward logic.

Quest Flow Summary:
1. Identify legacy items originally obtained through quests.
2. Restore missing NPCs, dialogue, and quest items.
3. Rebuild turn-in logic using classic item checks.
4. Recreate reward tables for legacy items.
5. Restore faction adjustments when historically required.
6. Validate all quest steps using 10_verification.sql.

This flow preserves classic authenticity while ensuring quests remain
solo-friendly and time-realistic for modern players.
