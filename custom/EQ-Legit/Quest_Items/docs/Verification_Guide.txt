Step 3 — Verify Spawns
SELECT id, npc_id, x, y, z
FROM spawn2
WHERE npc_id IN (list of restored quest NPC IDs);

Step 4 — Verify Turn-ins
SELECT * FROM quest_globals
WHERE name LIKE '%quest%';

Step 5 — Verify Rewards
SELECT * FROM quest_rewards
WHERE item_id IN (list of legacy reward IDs);

Step 6 — Verify Scripts
Check that restored NPCs respond to dialogue and turn-ins.
