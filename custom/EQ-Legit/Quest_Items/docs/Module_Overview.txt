EQ‑Legit — Quest Items Module
Module Overview

The Quest Items Module restores legacy items that were originally obtained
through classic EverQuest quests. Many of these quests were partially removed,
broken, or left incomplete in modern EQEmu databases, leaving their associated
legacy items unobtainable.

This module reintroduces:
- Missing quest NPCs and classic quest items
- Turn-in logic and reward flows
- Quest scripts and dialogue
- Correct faction adjustments (when required)
- Historically accurate quest progression

The Quest Items Module does not modify loot tables or rebuild orphaned NPC
ecosystems. It focuses exclusively on restoring quest-based legacy items using
clean, modular SQL and fully documented quest flows.
