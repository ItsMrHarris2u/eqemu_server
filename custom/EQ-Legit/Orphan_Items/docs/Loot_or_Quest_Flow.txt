EQ‑Legit — Orphan Items Module
Restoration Flow

This file explains how orphaned legacy items are restored through the
reconstruction of missing NPCs and their associated loot systems.

Restoration Flow Summary:
1. Identify legacy items with no valid drop source in the current database.
2. Determine the original NPCs or mechanics responsible for the item.
3. Rebuild missing NPCs using classic-era stats, levels, and behavior.
4. Restore classic spawn locations and timers.
5. Create or restore loottables and lootdrops for the orphaned items.
6. Apply EQ-Legit rarity tiers to ensure balanced, solo-friendly acquisition.
7. Validate all NPC wiring and drop logic using 10_verification.sql.

This flow preserves classic authenticity while ensuring orphaned legacy items
remain obtainable in a fair and consistent manner.
