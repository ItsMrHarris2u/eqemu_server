EQ‑Legit — Orphan Items Module
Spawn Map

This file documents the restored spawn locations for orphan NPCs. These
coordinates are based on classic-era placements and reinforce the intended
danger curve of early Cazic-Thule.

Swamp Entry (3 spawns):
- (-350, 150, 5)
- (-375, 175, 5)
- (-325, 125, 5)

Outer Temple (4 spawns):
- (-200, 300, 10)
- (-225, 325, 10)
- (-250, 350, 10)
- (-275, 375, 10)

Respawn Timer:
- 16 minutes (classic pacing)

These placements restore the original mosquito ecosystem without interfering
with existing CT NPCs or modernized content.
