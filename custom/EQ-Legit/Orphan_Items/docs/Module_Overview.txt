EQ‑Legit — Orphan Items Module
Module Overview

The Orphan Items Module restores legacy items whose original drop sources no
longer exist in modern EQEmu databases. These items were historically obtained
from NPCs or mechanics that were removed, relocated, or overwritten in later
revisions, leaving the items without a valid acquisition path.

This module reintroduces:
- Missing NPCs required for legacy item drops
- Classic spawn locations and behavior
- Correct loottables and drop rates
- Clean, modular SQL using the EQ-Legit 01–10 standard
- Documentation for long-term maintainability

The Orphan Items Module does not modify quests or existing NPCs. It focuses
exclusively on restoring missing NPC ecosystems required for legacy loot.
