EQ‑Legit — Orphan Items Module
NPC List

This file lists all NPCs restored or recreated to support orphaned legacy item
drops. These NPCs were removed from the database in later revisions and have
been rebuilt using classic-era data.

Restored NPCs:

a_mosquito (ID 700001)
- Level: 18
- Zone: Cazic-Thule
- Role: Rubicite dropper (minor)

a_bloodthirsty_mosquito (ID 700002)
- Level: 20
- Zone: Cazic-Thule
- Role: Rubicite dropper (moderate)

a_giant_mosquito (ID 700003)
- Level: 22
- Zone: Cazic-Thule
- Role: Rubicite dropper (major)

These NPCs were removed from modern EQEmu databases but existed in classic
Cazic-Thule as ambient threats and secondary Rubicite sources.
