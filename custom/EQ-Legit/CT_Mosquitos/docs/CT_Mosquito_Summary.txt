EQ‑Legit — EverQuest Legacy Item Restoration Project
CT Mosquito Restoration Module — Summary

The CT Mosquito Restoration Module restores the classic mosquito ecosystem
originally found in the swamp-entry and outer-temple regions of Cazic‑Thule.
These NPCs were removed in later database revisions, which disrupted both the
zone’s ecology and the Rubicite drop system.

This module reintroduces:
- Three classic mosquito NPCs
- Classic spawn locations
- Classic level ranges
- A unified Rubicite lootdrop
- Clean, modular SQL
- Zero interference with existing CT NPCs

NPCs restored:
- a mosquito (ID 700001, level 18)
- a bloodthirsty mosquito (ID 700002, level 20)
- a giant mosquito (ID 700003, level 22)
