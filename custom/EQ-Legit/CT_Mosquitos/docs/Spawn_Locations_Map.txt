CT Mosquito Restoration Module — Spawn Locations Map

Mosquito spawns are placed in their classic-era positions within Cazic‑Thule.
These locations reinforce the intended danger curve of early CT while keeping
the ecosystem clean and non-intrusive.

Swamp Entry (3 spawns):
- (-350, 150, 5)
- (-375, 175, 5)
- (-325, 125, 5)

Outer Temple (4 spawns):
- (-200, 300, 10)
- (-225, 325, 10)
- (-250, 350, 10)
- (-275, 375, 10)

Respawn Timer:
- 16 minutes (classic pacing)

These placements restore the original ambient threat and support the Rubicite
drop ecosystem without interfering with existing CT NPCs.
