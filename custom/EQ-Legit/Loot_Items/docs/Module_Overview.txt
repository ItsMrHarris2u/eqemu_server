EQ‑Legit — Loot Items Module
Module Overview

The Loot Items Module restores all legacy items that were originally obtained
through NPC loot tables. These items were removed, deprecated, or altered in
later database revisions, resulting in broken drop ecosystems and missing
classic-era loot paths.

This module reintroduces:
- All loot-based legacy items from the EQ-Legit master list
- Correct classic NPC drop sources
- Clean, normalized drop rates using the EQ-Legit rarity tiers
- Modular SQL using the universal 01–10 structure
- Documentation for long-term maintainability

The Loot Items Module does not modify quests, scripts, or faction systems.
It focuses exclusively on restoring loot-based legacy items in a clean,
authentic, and solo-friendly manner.
