EQ‑Legit — Loot Items Module
Spawn Map

This file documents the zones and spawn locations relevant to restored legacy
loot. Only NPCs whose loot tables were modified are included.

Example zones:

Lower Guk (Dead Side)
- Frenzied Ghoul: Room 3, static spawn
- Ghoul Lord: Throne Room, static spawn
- Executioner: Pit area, static spawn

Cazic-Thule
- Lizard Crusaders: Outer temple, roaming
- Lizard Zealots: Inner temple, static

This module does not modify spawn points; it documents them for reference and
verification.
