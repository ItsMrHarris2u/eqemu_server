Notes & Historical Corrections

This file documents corrections, clarifications, and historical notes related
to legacy loot restoration. It serves as a long-term reference for decisions
made during the reconstruction of classic and Kunark-era loot ecosystems.

------------------------------------------------------------
Correction: Circlet of Shadow (Pre‑Nerf)
------------------------------------------------------------

Item ID: 2308
Status: Restored (Kunark Legacy Loot)

The original drop source for the pre‑nerf Circlet of Shadow has been corrected
to reflect historically accurate Kunark-era behavior.

Correct Drop Source:
- a goblin bodyguard
- Temple of Droga
- Kunark expansion
- Drop Rate: 2.5% (EQ‑Legit legacy minimum)

Notes:
- This is the instant‑click version removed early in Velious.
- This item never dropped in Najena.
- This item never dropped from undead foremen in The Overthere.
- Confusion arises from mixing up:
    • "Circlet of Shadow"  (Kunark, instant-click, ID 2308)
    • "Circlet of Shadows" (Classic, Najena, ID 2309)
- Project 1999 and archived ZAM data both confirm Droga bodyguards as the
  canonical pre‑nerf source.

EQ‑Legit now reflects the correct Kunark-era drop behavior.

General Notes
------------------------------------------------------------

• All restored items follow the EQ‑Legit rarity tiers:
    - 2.5%  = Legacy Rare (minimum)
    - 5%    = Rare
    - 10%   = Uncommon
    - 15%   = Common

• Loot-only legacy items are restored without modifying quests, scripts,
  or faction systems.

• All loottable and lootdrop IDs follow the standardized 900xxx / 920xxx /
  930xxx structure for long-term maintainability.

• Additional corrections will be appended to this file as new legacy items
  are researched, verified, and restored.
