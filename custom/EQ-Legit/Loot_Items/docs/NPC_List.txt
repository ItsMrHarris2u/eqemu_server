EQ‑Legit — Loot Items Module
NPC List

This file lists all NPCs that have had legacy loot restored to their
loottables. Only NPCs that originally dropped legacy items in classic EverQuest
are included.

Example NPC entries:

Lower Guk — Frenzied Ghoul
- Drops: Rubicite Armor (select pieces)
- Drop Tier: 2.5%–15%

Lower Guk — Ghoul Lord
- Drops: Singing Steel (select pieces)
- Drop Tier: 5%–15%

Cazic-Thule — Lizard Crusaders
- Drops: Rubicite (historical variants)
- Drop Tier: 5%–10%

This module does not add new NPCs; it restores loot to existing classic NPCs
based on historical accuracy and EQ-Legit rarity standards.
