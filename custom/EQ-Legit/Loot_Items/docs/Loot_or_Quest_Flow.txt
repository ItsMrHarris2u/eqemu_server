EQ‑Legit — Loot Items Module
Loot Flow

This file explains how legacy loot is restored and how players obtain items
through the modernized EQ-Legit system.

Loot Flow Summary:
1. Identify classic-era NPCs that originally dropped the legacy item.
2. Restore the item to the correct NPC loottable.
3. Apply EQ-Legit rarity tiers:
   - 2.5% (ultra-rare)
   - 5% (rare)
   - 10% (uncommon)
   - 15% (common legacy)
4. Ensure no NPC exceeds one legacy drop per kill.
5. Validate all loottable links using 10_verification.sql.

This flow preserves classic authenticity while ensuring solo-friendly,
time-realistic acquisition.
